# Zipf's law project

This is an example project for the Good Research Code Handbook. It's a reinterpretation of the Zipf's law project from [Research Software Engineering in Python](https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/). [It reuses and modifies some of the code from the original project](https://github.com/merely-useful/py-rse/tree/book/zipf), which was licensed under a CC-BY license.
